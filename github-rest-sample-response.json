      "body": "- `react-testing-library` version: 8.0.4\r\n- `react` version: 16.8.6\r\n- `node` version: 10.16.0\r\n- `npm` (or `yarn`) version: yarn 1.16.0\r\n\r\n### Relevant code or config:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nawait wait(fn);\r\n```\r\nin a production (minified) build never completes.\r\n\r\n### What you did:\r\n\r\nWe're attempting to upgrade from `react-testing-library` 6.0.1 to `@testing-library/react` 8.0.4 but have hit an issue:\r\n\r\nWe run our tests in a production (minified) build, in order to be certain that our minified code is actually behaving correctly. (We've had issues where the generated code doesn't work in some browsers, so we make sure we test the actual code we're going to ship, which means building our tests in production mode.)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our test suite hangs when we upgrade `testing-library`: the calls to `wait()` now never complete.\r\n \r\n### What happened:\r\n\r\nWe attempted to upgrade `react-testing-library` and now many of our tests lock up and never complete.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport * as rtl from '@testing-library/react';\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * An asynchronous function that just runs @testing-library/react#wait()\r\n * and checks to see if that completes.\r\n */\r\nasync function runIt() {\r\n  const timeoutHandle = setTimeout(() => {\r\n    console.error(\"Five seconds on, and wait still hasn't completed\");\r\n  }, 5000);\r\n\r\n  await rtl.wait(() => {\r\n    console.log(\"This is the function we are waiting for, now complete\");\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  clearTimeout(timeoutHandle);\r\n  console.log(\"The wait function returned; it's all working fine!\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nrunIt();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code sets up a timer that complains after 5 seconds, then runs a simple `wait` call, and waits for it to complete. After it completes, it cancels the timer and indicates that everything is working fine.\r\n\r\nIn a development build it reports that everything is working fine.  In a production build, the timer goes off, indicating that `wait` didn't complete.\r\n\r\nTo make it easy to run this, I've added the above code to a [Github repo](https://github.com/RoystonS/react-testing-library-wait-never-finishes). This is an out-of-the-box `create-react-app` application (commit 1) with the above code pasted into the `index.js` file ([commit 2](https://github.com/RoystonS/react-testing-library-wait-never-finishes/commit/30b97ac9ca92b0d142c7031d259daf141e2a7dfd))\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. check out that repo\r\n1. `yarn`\r\n1. `yarn build`\r\n1. (assuming you have `serve` installed):  `serve -s build`\r\n1. View the page in a browser, and look in the console\r\n\r\nHere's what it _should_ say:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19773/60913847-2f9f6680-a280-11e9-8290-94a50255e69f.png)\r\n\r\nbut it'll actually say something like:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19773/60913591-a9832000-a27f-11e9-91aa-b4a21c4c2925.png)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf possible, please create a repository that reproduces the issue with the\r\nminimal amount of code possible.\r\n\r\nTemplate repo: https://github.com/alexkrolick/dom-testing-library-template\r\n\r\nOr if you can, try to reproduce the issue in a Codesandbox. You can fork the one\r\nhere: https://codesandbox.io/s/5z6x4r7n0p\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Problem description:\r\n\r\nIt means that the code that `@testing-library/react` is generating is not working properly when incorporated into a production build using the default `create-react-app` settings. (Actually, the codebase where we found this _isn't_ using `create-react-app`: we've just managed to boil it down to this trivial example.)\r\n\r\n### Suggested solution:\r\n\r\nI'm really not sure. I've traced through the minified code and it seems to be getting stuck inside the regenerator code in the new `asyncWrapper`.  I don't know whether it's a bug in `terser` or something in the `react-testing-library` code that isn't quite right but which happens to work in a non-production build but fails in a production build.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Here's another way of saying it:\r\n\r\n> I guess the other way to describe the difference here is that the `s3-bucket-policy-full-access` creates a policy which is attached to the S3 bucket and defines some list of IAM principals which can access the bucket. While the `iam-full-access` is creating policies (2, one requiring MFA and one not), that can be associated with IAM users/roles and used to provide access that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n* [ ] rename the resources: `s3-full-access` to `s3-bucket-policy-full-access` and `bucket-full-access` to `iam-policy-full-access`.\r\n* [ ] There are 3 pairs of IAM data sources and resources, move each to their own module.\r\n* [ ] Update this module to use those new IAM modules.\r\n* [ ] Add a boolean variable for each of the 3 IAM policies the module creates (which enables/disables the policies from being created), passing those to the new IAM modules.\r\n* [ ] Review / update the module docs for clarity and to explain how this module works",

      "body": "While Let's Encrypt has no plans to implement the external account binding (EAB) functionality defined in [RFC 8555 §7.3.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555#section-7.3.4) in Boulder it would be valuable for the ACME ecosystem if there was an easy way for client developers to test this protocol feature.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to configure Pebble such that its directory contains the `externalAccountRequired` meta key. In this configuration all `newAccount` requests must be rejected unless they have the `externalAccountBinding` JWS request field. Pebble will also need to implement the `externalAccountRequired` error type to return when rejecting requests for this reason.\r\n\r\nIn the Pebble config file it should be possible to configure multiple base64url-encoded MAC keys alongside an identifying name for use for verifying the `externalAccountBinding` requests. We should update the management interface to allow clients to access the configured MAC keys in a Pebble-specific testing manner to compose the expected `externalAccountBinding` signatures, simulating the out-of-band communication of the shared secret.\r\n\r\nFor now I think its sufficient to verify the `externalAccountBinding` value of `newAccount` requests according to 7.3.4 and somehow display the MAC key name that was used in the verification, but not actually link the account to any external state or somehow modify the authorization process.",

      "body": "I ran across https://blurha.sh/ recently (via @jamo) which looks like an excellent blur-up — better than our existing method of relying on the browser to upscale a 20px image.\r\n\r\nWould be interesting to try adding support for this to gatsby-plugin-sharp/gatsby-transformer-sharp/gatsby-image.\r\n\r\nThis would be an extra field on the image type that does the pre-processing. The library also includes a JS client library ([1.6kb](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=blurhash@1.1.0)) that we'd include with gatsby-image — probably as an optional export e.g. `import Img from \"gatsby-image/with-blurha\"` or we could document how to pre-process the generated string to convert it back to an image.\r\n\r\nWould someone like to try putting together a prototype so we can see how this works for real? Perhaps add this as another tab to https://using-gatsby-image.gatsbyjs.org/",

      "body": "\r\nElementor v2.6 Pro beta is here and we would love to get feedback from you!\r\nLiked the new Icon Library? You will LOOOVE what we have in Pro!\r\n\r\n**Before you test, please make sure you are using:**\r\n\r\n- **Elementor Core v2.6.0**\r\n- **Elementor Pro v2.6.0 beta2**\r\n\r\n\r\n## Meet Custom Icon Libraries (#110)\r\n\r\n![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45009641/60905029-e7cb1000-a27c-11e9-91a7-fc38f3475c42.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of our top priorities is making sure Elementor Pro users get the most advanced and cutting edge design capabilities. With this release, it's the first time users are able to integrate to three of the leading icon libraries font generators: Fontello, IcoMoon, and Fontastic.\r\n\r\nThis way, you can be sure you'll always be able to find just the right icon for your project.\r\n\r\nAll of your custom icon sets are accessible through a single interface, allowing you to create your favorite icons packs, and use them throughout your workflow.\r\n\r\nThe upload process is super simple, and once it is done, all the icons will be available inside the new Icon Library.\r\n\r\nEvery icon you use, no matter which library, is edited and styled using Elementor's native styling controls. It completely changes the usual way designers work with custom icons. Don’t settle for pre-made icon sets. Build your own sets and style them inside Elementor.\r\n \r\n**Test flow:**\r\n\r\n- Go to one of the supported icon libraries generators mentioned above and create an icon set (make sure to use unique prefix per icons set).\r\n- In your dashboard go to Elementor > Custom Icons and click on “Add New” button.\r\n- Set your title, and upload your pre-made Icon set.\r\n- Make sure all of the details mentioned are correct and the icons are being displayed properly.\r\n- Click “Publish” and create a new Page/Post.\r\n- Add any widget uses an icon, and select your newly created library\r\n- Browse through your uploaded icons, insert one and play with the design settings.\r\n- Make sure everything works as expected in both the Editor and on Frontend.\r\n\r\n## Font Awesome Pro Integration (#4430)\r\nWe added Font Awesome 5 for all our users, but for all you Pro users, you get a whole lot more, with easy integration to Font Awesome 5 Pro.\r\n\r\nAll you need to do is add your Font Awesome 5 Pro kit ID, and you'll get instant access to 5,300+ smashing Font Awesome Pro icons directly to your Elementor Icon Library.\r\n\r\n**Note:** this feature is only available to Font Awesome Pro subscribers.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Test flow:**\r\n\r\n- In your dashboard go to Elementor > Settings > Integrations tab.\r\n- Scroll to the Font Awesome Pro row, fill in your Font Awesome Pro Kit ID and click “Validate Kit ID”\r\n- After receiving confirmation click on “Save Changes” button\r\n- Create a new page and insert any widget uses an icon\r\n- Browse throughout the new icon families added and insert one of the presented icons.\r\n- Make sure everything works as expected in both the Editor and on Frontend.\r\n\r\n## reCAPTCHA v3 integration (#8213, #6039, #7165)\r\n\r\nWith the recent Facebook security outage, it’s clear that website security is important for every site, large or small...\r\n\r\nLuckily, we have your back and added reCAPTCHA v3 to our form user validation.\r\n\r\nreCAPTCHA v3 works like magic. It monitors the user with almost no interruption and gives a quality score behind the scenes based on the user’s actions. This way, only suspicious users (AKA bots) are given the validation fields, and the experience of screened users remains uninterrupted.\r\n\r\nAs an admin, you can set the score threshold you desire, zero being the ‘loose’  score and one being the ‘strict’ score.\r\n\r\nMuch like FontAwesome 5 Pro, the integration is simple and straightforward. \r\n\r\nBetter luck elsewhere, hackers. This user uses Elementor forms!\r\n\r\n**Test flow:**\r\n\r\n- In your dashboard go to Elementor > Settings > Integrations tab.\r\n- Scroll to the Google reCAPTCHA v3 row, fill in your Site Key, Secret Key and the Score Threshold you are willing to accept as valid score for users.\r\n- Click on “Save Changes” button.\r\n- Create a new page and insert a form.\r\n- Add new field and set it’s type to reCAPTCHA v3.\r\n- Make sure everything works as expected on Frontend.\r\n\r\n## Popup Exit Animation (#7063)\r\n\r\nMany of our users wanted us to add the Exit Animation feature to our Popups, and finally it's here.\r\n\r\nFor exit animation, once the user closes the popup, instead of the popup disappearing immediately, you can pick a more subtle or unique exit like fade out.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Test flow:**\r\n\r\n- Go to Dashboard > Templates > Popups > Add New.\r\n- Name your template and click ‘Create Template’.\r\n- Choose a template from the Library, or built your popup from scratch.\r\n- Under ‘Popup Settings’ set your Exit Animation\r\n- Set different Exit Animation for mobile\r\n- Set your triggers and conditions\r\n- Make sure everything works as expected on Frontend.\r\n\r\n## Support taxonomy ACF Dynamic Tags in Archive pages (#5147)\r\n\r\nArchive pages are super important, whether if it’s the blogs front page, the different products categories or even in a hotel archive pages.\r\n\r\nIn this release, we took care of the dynamic structure of those pages. \r\nFor example, if you have a shoe shop you will be able to place a dynamic banner that will introduce an image of men shoes from an ACF field, and women shoes in the women archive page. \r\n\r\nThe options for customizing your taxonomy archive pages dynamically are limitless, starting from customizing tags, categories, authors or any other custom taxonomy you could think of.\r\n\r\nStart creating your personalized archive pages with Elementor Pro v2.6 now.  \r\n\r\n**Test flow:**\r\n\r\n- Use ACF to add a custom text field and custom image gallery to your ‘Categories’ taxonomy.\r\n- Go to Posts > Categories and fill in the fields specified above in one of your categories.\r\n- In your dashboard go to Templates > Theme Builder and create an Archive template.\r\n- In your archive template place a Heading widget and Image Gallery widget and set its source to Dynamic > ACF field > Set the ‘Key’ to the corresponding field.\r\n- Make sure you see the values you added and that everything works as expected on Frontend.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n## More Improvements\r\n\r\n- Tweak: Added Dynamic capabilities for Form Redirect (#7552)\r\n- Tweak: Added Logged In Message styling options for Login widget (#7928)\r\n- Tweak: Added `none` breakpoint option to Nav-menu widget (#7916)\r\n- Tweak: Added option to place post terms without links (#8366)\r\n- Tweak: Added `elementor/query/query_results` hook to `query-control` to allow full control over results for developers (#7912)​\r\n- Tweak: Price Table -

The story-board should lead users on a journey, continuously calling them to a single action and inviting them to other actions along the way. The target user should be someone unfamiliar with our district or the Church of the Nazarene, but it should still make sense to someone who knows us better.\r\n\r\n1. Make “Find a Church” the only call-to-action button/link in the top navigation for the homepage.\r\n\r\n2. Then have a diptych inviting people to give (link to online giving form) or attend an event (link to  calendar); reiterate “Find a Church” for people to attend a service or other local church event near them or support a local ministry through giving.\r\n\r\n3. Then have a triptych introducing people to our auxiliaries (SDMI, NMI, NMI); reiterate “Find a Church” for people to get involved locally.\r\n\r\n4. Then have an at-a-glance introduction inviting people to meet our leaders (link to District Officers or District Organization) and check out our other district ministries (links to MCNC and PDCD); reiterate “Find a Church” for people to get involved in the unique ministry opportunities near them.\r\n\r\n5.
